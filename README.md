## 📌 1. Problems and Background

Road accidents are a leading cause of injury and death worldwide, affecting both urban and rural populations. This dashboard visualizes data on **417,883 total casualties**, segmented by **casualty severity**, **vehicle type**, **location**, **road type**, **surface condition**, and **time period**.

The increasing number of casualties — especially **slight (351,436)** and **serious (59,312)** — highlights the urgent need for targeted road safety measures and infrastructure planning.

---

## 💡 2. Solution

To address the rising number of road casualties, this project delivers:

- **Data Analysis**: Breakdown of casualties by road conditions, vehicle types, accident timing, and more.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Identification of key accident contributors such as road type, lighting, and surface condition.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Actionable insights for urban planners, transport departments, and road safety agencies.
